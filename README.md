# Interactive Photo Gallery

This project is an **Interactive Photo Gallery** that allows users to filter and sort images based on categories and other criteria. The gallery is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality. The images can be filtered by categories such as Nature, Animals, Architecture, and more. Additionally, the gallery allows sorting by name or date.

## Features

- **Filter Images**: The gallery can filter images by categories like Nature, Animals, Architecture, and Scenario.
- **Sort Images**: The images can be sorted alphabetically by name or by date.
- **Responsive Design**: The gallery layout adjusts to different screen sizes using CSS Grid.
- **Hover Effect**: Images in the gallery scale up slightly when hovered over for a nice visual effect.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the gallery and filter/sort controls.
